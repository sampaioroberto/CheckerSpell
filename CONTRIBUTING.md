## üöÄ Branch Naming Convention

To keep our repository organized and make it easier to track work, we follow this branch naming pattern:

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

### üîπ Types:
| Type      | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| feature   | For new features or enhancements                 |
| fix       | For bug fixes                                    |
| refactor  | For code improvements without functional changes |
| test      | For adding or updating tests                     |
| docs      | For documentation updates                        |

### üîπ Examples:
| Purpose                                  | Branch name                      |

| Update README (Issue #30)                | `docs/30-update-readme`          |
| Add move tests (Issue #18)               | `test/18-move-tests`             |

### üîπ Tips:
- Use **kebab-case** (lowercase with hyphens) for the description.
- Keep the description short and meaningful.
- Always include the **issue number** to link the branch to the related task.
- Mention the issue in your Pull Request description using keywords like `Closes #12` to automatically close the issue when merging.
